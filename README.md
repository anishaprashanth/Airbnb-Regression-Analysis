# Airbnb-Regression-Analysis

 When picking an Airbnb, we prioritize some things and compromise on others. We are going to look at
 Airbnb data which consists of many possible factors that people consider when selecting an Airbnb. Using
 regression analysis, we will determine if and how they are related to each other. In other words, we are
 looking for possible correlations such as whether a closer distance to the city is associated with a higher
 listing price.

 Knowing that a reasonable price is one of the biggest priorities when choosing an Airbnb, we want to find
 out what factors significantly affect an Airbnbâ€™s price in San Francisco. Some variables that we examined
 are the distance between the Airbnb and the center of San Francisco, the accommodations of the Airbnb,
 the review scores of the Airbnb, and many other variables.
